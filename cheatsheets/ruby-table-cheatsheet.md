### General Concepts

| Concept  | Usage                   | Example               | Description                                                  |

| Comment  | `# comment`             | `# this is a comment` | Ruby ignores comments - just there for you as information    |
| Variable | `variable = some_value` | `name = "Mary"`       | Used to store data - points to (**references**) the object in memory. Gives a label to a value, can use variable name to recall value later in program. |
